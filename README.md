# IceCast2 PHP API

## Warning: This project is EOL, outdated and has been abandoned. Use it at your own risk.

## Overview
This is fully functional, easy-to-use, RESTful API interface for your icecast2-based radio station.
It's based on a popular Slim Framework which makes it very flexible and reliable solution.

Featues:
* Easy to configure.
* Integration with memcached for high performance.
* Rapid deployment within a minute.
* Multiple mountpoint support!
* Easy to extend.
* Different response types: JSON or XML.
* Mount fallback support!
* It is awesome!

It allows you to:
* Show number of listeners per mountpoint.
* Show current track per mountpoint with timestamp.
* Show last N tracks per mountpoiint alwo with their timestamps.
* Show total number of current listeners online.
* Show album art via GraceNote for current track.

## Install
It's never been so easy if you're using composer.
Just unpack it to your api's root directory, and install the dependencies:

```php composer.phar install```

## Configuration
After all dependencies are installed, it's the time to configure our new API.
Well, it's pretty simple, just edit the $config array:
```
//IceCast API Config
$config = array(
	'icecast_server_hostname' 		 => 'radio.example.com', //icecast2 server hostname or IP
	'icecast_server_port'			 => 80, 
	'icecast_admin_username' 		 => 'admin', //admin username
	'icecast_admin_password' 	     => 'hackme', //admin password
	
	
	//unused
	'icecast_listener_auth_header_title'			=> 'icecast-auth-user',
	'icecast_listener_auth_header_value'			=> '1',
	'icecast_listener_auth_header_reject_reason' 	=> 'Rejected',
	
	//If you have an event based mounts(e.g. for live broadcasting), 
	//you should configure fallback map below according to your icecast2 config file.
	//Read the docs for more info.
	'icecast_mount_fallback_map' => array('live' => 'nonstop',  // from => to
									  'trance'  => 'trance.nonstop',
									  'house'	=> 'house.nonstop'),
									  
	'playlist_logfile' 		 => '/var/log/icecast2/playlist.log', // must be available for reading
	
	'use_memcached' 		 => false, // Enable memcached support: true | false
	'use_db'				 => false, // Enable db support: true | false  (unused atm)

	'memcached' 			 => array('host' 		=> '127.0.0.1', 
									  'port' 		=> 11211, 
									  'lifetime' 	=> 5, // lifetime of the cache in seconds
									  'compressed'  => 0), // compress data stored with memcached? 1 or 0. Requires zlib.
									  
	'db'					=> array('host'			=> '127.0.0.1',
									 'port'			=> 3306,
									 'user'			=> 'dbuser',
									 'password'		=> 'dbpassword'),			
	'max_amount_of_history'	 => '20', // max limit of requested items of playback history
	'xmlrootnode'			 => 'response', // Root node name for the response using XML.
	'album_art_folder'		 => getcwd().'/storage/albums/',   // cache folder for albums art images. With trailing slash. Normally, u shouldn't change this.
	'gracenote'				 => array('clientID' 	=> '',
									  'clientTag' 	=> '',
									  'userID' 		=> '',
								),
	'default_storage_folder' => getcwd().'/storage/default/', // default static folder. Normally, u shouldn't change this.
);

```
## Mount Fallback map
I think every popular radiostation hosts a live broadcasts. But with all it's popularity, it comes with some problems, if you're using default Icecast2 fallback mechanic.
When live source hits the air, listeners are being automatically moved to its mountpoint, leaving the old nonstop mount completely empty.
In order to continue providing actual data to your API clients you need to detect when live broadcast is going up and alter your data "on-the-fly".

To bring this thing to work you need to configure Mount Fallback map according to your station's archeticture.

So, for example, if you have live(for DJs) mount called "live" with following configuration in icecast.xml:
```
<mount>
  <mount-name>/live</mount-name>
	<stream-name>MyRadio Main RJ Stream</stream-name>
  <fallback-mount>/myradio.nonstop</fallback-mount>
	<fallback-override>1</fallback-override>
	<mp3-metadata-interval>2048</mp3-metadata-interval>
	<password>pwd</password>
</mount>
```
Just bring the `icecast_mount_fallback_map` to the following state:
```
'icecast_mount_fallback_map'   => array('live' => 'myradio.nonstop'),
```
That' all. Now your API service will provide data from the live mount when it's active or from the one it's associated with, if it's down.


## Getting an album and artist art from Gracenote for your current track
Now, this API also allows you to show an album cover wherever you want. But, you have to do some steps in order to setup this feature.
* First, go to https://developer.gracenote.com/ and make yourself an account if dont have one.
* After creating your application, gracenote will provide you with clientTag and clientID.
* Add them to your config file and launch yourapihost.com/gracenote-php/register.php . 
* If everything went OK, you should get your userID key. Save it to your config file.
That's it. 
For example, you can try requesting youapihost.com/cover/Nickelback/Lullaby for album image, and youapihost.com/cover/Nickelback for artist image.

Dont forget to make storage folders writable.
Also note, that when album cover image is pulled from gracenote' api for the first time, API then saves it on the filesystem, making subsequent request on same image much faster.

## Performance
Thanks to built-in memcached support your new api service has, quite literally,  unrival performance.

Here are some tests result:

1630 RPS against 407.
Not bad, huh? Whatcha think?

## Requirements
To make everything run smoothly, you need to have the following software installed:

* PHP 5.3 >=
* cURL
* libXML
* (optional) memcached & memcache



## Demos
So, the best demo is the working project, right?
This API is fully integrated and succesfuly working at the most popular russian 
online gaming station called "Tort.FM". It was developed for that project, eventually.

Here you go:
### Current listeners from tort.fm main mountpoint, xml response:
<http://api.tort.fm/radio/tort.fm/listeners/xml/>
### Current track from tort.fm main mountpoint, json response:
<http://api.tort.fm/radio/tort.fm/song/json/>
### Last 7 tracks from our trance channel, xml response:
<http://api.tort.fm/radio/trance/history/7/xml/>
### Total listeners, xml response:
<http://api.tort.fm/radio/TotalListeners/xml/>
### Album art, jpg response:
<http://api.tort.fm/radio/cover/Nickelback/Lullaby/>
### Artist art, jpg response:
<http://api.tort.fm/radio/cover/Nickelback/>

## Extend
If you want to add your custom functionality, just create additional methods in icecast_api.php file using this template:
```
private function YourCustomMethodAction(array $args){
		return array('Hello' => 'Im a template for your custom methods.');
} 
```
Note: There is a strict rules applied to the names of your methods. It has to have the following format: {methodname}Action.

Then create new route block inside index.php file like this:
```
$app->get('/customMethod/:variable/:responseType(/)', function ($variable, $responseType) use ($icecastApi, $app) {

  $app->response()->header("Content-Type", "application/".$responseType);
  echo $icecastApi->Request('YourCustomMethod',array('your_var' => $variable))->Response($responseType);
	
})->conditions(array("responseType" => "(json|xml)"));
```
This is it. You can find these templates within the files aswell.
